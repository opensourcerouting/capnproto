# Building Debian (Ubuntu) Package for Cap'n Proto

This branch is inspired on the excellent work of Thomas Lee
See https://github.com/thomaslee/capnproto-debian

However, we (at NetDEF) needed features beyond the current stable
branch, so this branch defines a 0.5.99 version which is based
on 0.6-dev (Development branch).
